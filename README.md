# w-rebuild
Collection of notes, scripts and configs to automate reinstallation, setup and config of Windows 10/11 systems with all the software I use. 

I made this for personal use to save time and streamline the process.

Currently including:

-Installation scripts to install software using winget or chocolatey

-Unattend files to automate parts of the installation and initial config of systems (WIP)

-List of Windows software that may or may not be useful at some point 

-List of useful links to other projects tha may be relevant
