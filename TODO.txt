Make definitive list of tweaks and tools to use (possibly look into microsoft tools made for OEM and similar instead of using third party tools)

Do research on unattend files for automating configs during the installation process

Make definitive list of software to install on fresh installations and do research on user and systemwide installation of software on windows.

Research mounting virtual disks/machines to bear metal and advantages or disadvantages

Do more testing in virtual machines, specifically test the third party tweakers and recommended software

Decide whether to keep using 10 or switch to 11 (probably go to 11 for newer tweak/ricing support and general future proofing)

Figure out partition scheme for next system/setup

Make a naming scheme for devices/domain/users/disks on new setup

Make a user scheme (local administrator, everyday user, unsafe user for running sketchy things)

Find best practices for hardening and security of devices and systems (where reasonable)

Look into encryption of disks and systems. Windows can encrypt C with Bitlocker, LUKS can work for Linux, shared stroage can be encrypted with third party tools (Apparently VeraCrypt works for that).

Look into network configuration for security, blocking inbound connections in firewall except where needed for hosting servers for games and whatnot, figure out which applications would need to have inbound connections allowed. Look into addressing scheme and hostname scheme for devices on the network. Also perhaps look into monitoring ingress/egress network traffic either on devices themselves OR with an external device and perhaps even a system to store/analize logs and delete them after some time.
