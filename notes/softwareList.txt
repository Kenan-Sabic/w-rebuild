1. Speedtest CLI (OOKLA)

Browsers:
1. Firefox (MPL 2.0) - great extensions, widely supported
2. Brave (MPL 2.0) - chromium based; pros: privacy, ad-blocking, Chome extensions; cons: crypto wallet
3. Falkon (GPL) - made by KDE, based on QTWebEngine which is based on chromium; pros: apparently light on resources, built-in adblock, portable; cons: no extensions
4. Ungoogled Chromium (BSD 3-Clause License) - blocks google stuff, even the web store, needs configuration
5. Opera (Proprietary) - chromium based, no comment
6. Edge (MIT kinda) - chromium based, comes installed on windows; pros: apparently best security, fancy microsoft integrations, already installed; cons: spyware, annoying ads, ugly
7. OperaGX (Proprietary) - chromium based, fancy UI; pros: lots of builtin features, can limit resource use
8. Chrome (Proprietary kinda) - lots of fancy google integrations; pros: pretty good security, wide support; cons: spyware, can't block ads on it well

2. TeamViewer (Proprietary) - works alright, requires account ;available on winget
3. Remote Desktop Connection (windows builtin) - uses RDP which is very performant but proprietary microsoft tech, works pretty good with other windows devices, can self host.
4. RustDesk (AGPL-3.0-only) - nice self hosting option, have yet to use this one.
5. TigerVNC (GNU General Public License v2.0) - pretty easy to use, uses VNC which is widely supported across devices. Used it to config raspberry pi.

SSH Client:
1. PuTTY (MIT) - used for SSH for a long time, lot of people swear by it.

FTP Client:
1. WinSCP (GPL) - two column file management with plenty of FTP and SCP options, integrates with putty and follows system theme, has tabs. Seems pretty good and lots of options.
2. ffftp (BSD-2-Clause License) - a bit uglier than WinSCP but familiar layout. Lots of options and features
